The roller-coaster of life and a relocation to the Pacific Northwest (Portland, Oregon to be exact) prompted a deep, deep reflection on over a decade of electronic music making. **Multnomah (2020)** is Yarred's most meticulously-constructed and emotionally-charged album to date, with a cinematic synthwave flavor undergirding interlinked melodies, sequences, and rhythms which glorify the majestic beauty of the west.
