**Circuits of Joy (2015)** contains previously unreleased or newly remastered material from 2003 to October 2015. Don't miss the nearly 15 minutes of Berlin School-esque _Twin Roads_, a synth extravaganza comprised of several movements which draw on inspiration from 80's rock, techno, classic electronica, ambient, and disco.
