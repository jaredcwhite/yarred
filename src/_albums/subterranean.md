This album essentially began 20 years ago—simultaneously representing some of the most diverse explorations of various forms of electronica yet with the sound remaining entirely consistent. This is the hardest I've pushed into dance subgenres. At the same time, the influences of chillwave, ambient, and retro electronic music from the 80s and 90s cannot be denied. **Subterranean (2024)** is a collection of tracks which are rooted in genre yet entirely transcend it. At the end of the day, it is simply music made on synthesizers with love—and perhaps the occasional spark of divine fire.
