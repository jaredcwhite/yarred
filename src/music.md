From 2007-2010, Yarred was part of an electronic music duo known as **Binary Sea**. They released two albums, [_Compass_](http://blazingedgeproductions.com/compass.html) (2008) and [_Land Ho!_](http://blazingedgeproductions.com/land_ho.html) (2010), featuring a wide array of ambient and electronica styles.

From 1993-2005, Yarred recorded and toured extensively with the Celtic & Early Music band **Distant Oaks**. Their magnum opus, [_Gach LÃ  agus Oidhche: Music of Carmina Gadelica_](http://blazingedgeproductions.com/car_gad.html) (2003) is a tour de force of traditional yet surprisingly fresh Scottish Gaelic song and dance music. In the words of one Amazon reviewer, "if you are a fan of celtic music artfully done and with craft and heritage, this is a must-listen-to."
