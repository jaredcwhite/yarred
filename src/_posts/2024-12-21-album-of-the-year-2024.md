title: Album of the Year for 2024
---

It's that time again when I publish my "Album of the Year", an honorable tradition here at the YARRED website.

Just kidding‚Äîthis is the first time I've done this. üòÇ (I had two goals this year: [release a new album](2024/09/23/subterranean/) for the first time in ages, and start blogging about other music I love. _Score on both counts!_)

Before I unveil my album of the year, let me note a few previous years. I think my routine will be to choose an album that's squarely in the genre I adore (retro-flavored electronica: chillwave, Berlin School, etc.), alongside a more mainstream runner-up.

In **2022**: my Album of the Year was [Riviera](https://lavenue.bandcamp.com/album/riviera) by L'Avenue (I was absolutely _obsessed_ with this album‚Äîparticularly the track _Warm Breeze_), and the pop runner-up was [Dawn FM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_FM) by The Weeknd (I've listened to this one so-o-o many times‚Äîincredible stuff).

And in **2023**: my Album of the Year was [Hydragate](https://music.apple.com/us/album/hydragate/1689765000) by S.A.W. (how could it not be when it features the illustrious Johannes Schmoelling, formerly of Tangerine Dream), and the pop runner-up was [Bebe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebe_(album)).

So‚Ä¶**drumroll please‚Ä¶**

## My Album of the Year for 2024 is Into the Unknown by Nero

[![Into the Unknown album cover](/images/nero-into-the-unknown.jpg)](https://music.apple.com/us/album/into-the-unknown/1756362880)

To say [Into the Unknown](https://music.apple.com/us/album/into-the-unknown/1756362880) was a long-awaited follow-up to Nero's ground-breaking debut album _Welcome Reality_ (2011) and the less impressive but still good sequel _Between II Worlds_ (2015) is an understatement.

Band members Dan Stephens, Joe Ray, and Alana Watson took the world of electronic dance music by storm with their crossover appeal and masterful fusion of multiple genres and touchstones‚Äîhard-hitting often menacing synth pyrotechnics combined with the glass-shattering soprano vocals of Watson. And they shot to superstardom upon their collaboration with Skrillex on the dubstep remix of _Promises_. This **was** the sound of the early 2010s.

Now I don't mean to imply _Between II Worlds_ is a bad album. It's quite good in fact‚Ä¶it just wasn't **brilliant** to the degree that _Welcome Reality_ was. It's hard to produce great sequels! Thus the question quickly became: could Nero complete the trilogy successfully and with panache?

Thankfully I'm‚Äîfinally‚Äîhere to report that _Into the Unknown_ is **awesome**.

I have a bunch of favorite tracks on here, but the one that really stands out for me is _Gravity_. It's more akin to the vibes of a synthwave record than drum'n'bass or dubstep‚Ä¶which perhaps is why I love it so much. It's just a very pleasing song to listen to, masterfully executed.

Another standout that's more on the wild side is _Draw Energy_. We're squarely in hardcore electronic territory on this one‚Äîmore of an assult on the ears than a song in the traditional sense. **And I love it.**

It's possible to claim the "heights" of _Into the Unknown_ don't quite hit the heights of _Welcome Reality_. On the other hand‚Ä¶this just might be a "better" album overall. It holds together extremely well, one track conceptually flowing into the next, and Alana Watson has never sounded better. What a pair of pipes she has!

I'm so happy Nero pulled through and over the course of 13 years delivered an electronic music album trilogy that is unparalled in the field. Bravo Nero. Well done.

As for the pop runner-up for Album of the Year for 2024, it is:

## eternal sunshine by Ariana Grande

I will fully admit: I am not the target demographic for the fanbase of Ariana Grande. And I will admit yet again, I haven't even heard anything else she's done. All I can tell you is my kids were listening to songs from this album, and my ears perked up. There's some really excellent material on here‚Äî_supernatural_, _the boy is mine_, _yes, and?_, _we can't be friends (wait for your love)_‚Ä¶bangers all. My only real complaint is one I have with most modern pop music: **way too much Auto-Tune** on all the vocals. I don't really get it: we \*know\* that Ariana Grande can really sing! Why mess it up with that weird robotic warble effect? Ugh.

But no matter. [eternal sunshine](https://arianagrande.fandom.com/wiki/Eternal_Sunshine_(album)) is a very good pop album, and I'm glad to give the nod to Glinda. üòè

## Honorable Mention: 

I very nearly gave my Album of the Year award to [80s Ambient Reinventions](https://music.apple.com/us/album/80s-ambient-reinventions/1783402907) by State Azure, only‚Ä¶it's actually an EP-length compilation of songs released over the past several years. They are all covers of famous 80s songs, from _Running Up That Hill_ to _Love Comes Quickly_, done in a sequencer-laden ambient/Berlin-School instrumental style that is **achingly exquisite**. Every moment of this album is \*chef's kiss\*, and that really doesn't come as a surprise considering State Azure has been making some of the best ambient electronica in the world for a long while now‚Äînot to mention they are behind [the best Tangerine Dream covers](https://stateazure.bandcamp.com/album/dreams) I've ever heard.

**So there you have it.** My Album(s) of the Year for 2024. What will we be graced with in 2025? _Stay tuned!_

(And also stay tuned for more YARRED music, coming at you in the New Year. Yeah baby! ü§ò)
