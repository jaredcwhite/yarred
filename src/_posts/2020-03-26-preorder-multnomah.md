Three years in the making, **Multnomah** is at long last [here for your listening pleasure!](https://store.yarred.com/album/multnomah) Retreat to a quiet spot, turn up the volume, and be transported.

From the [Bandcamp album description](https://store.yarred.com/album/multnomah):

> The roller-coaster of life and a relocation to the Pacific Northwest (Portland, Oregon to be exact) prompted a deep, deep reflection on over a decade of electronic music making. **Multnomah (2020)** is Yarred's most meticulously-constructed and emotionally-charged album to date, with a cinematic synthwave flavor undergirding interlinked melodies, sequences, and rhythms which glorify the majestic beauty of the west.

[Pre-order Today!](https://store.yarred.com/album/multnomah) Final release date is Tuesday, March 31, 2020.
