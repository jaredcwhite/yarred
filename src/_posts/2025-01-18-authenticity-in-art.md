title: Authenticity in the Pursuit of Art

<section markdown="block" style="color: #f0f2ca; font-size: 110%">

I don't make music which has lyrics. Perhaps I shall one day in the future, when I've worked up the courage to put my singing voice out there. It's tricky, because [my mom was a fabulous singer](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/6676411), and I never felt like I could live up to her standards in this area.

But I digress. While I am a instrumentalist at heart, I do appreciate a quality song and a resonant voice. And in the never ending saga of "Jared discovers a thing everyone else has known for decades üòÇ", I recently had a _moment_ as I was introduced to the fantastical talents of **Sin√©ad O‚ÄôConnor**.

(You can blame the Apple TV+ show _Bad Sisters_ for that!)

Thus far, I haven't even made my way through O'Connor's most popular and recognizable material. I somehow landed on her 2000 album _Faith and Courage_ and stayed there for a while, marveling at a quality I find very hard to uncover with a lot of the pop songs I hear these days: **raw, unbridled authenticity**.

You might even say there's an edge of activism in some of the lyrics, which I know can rub some folks the wrong way (you're an entertainer! keep your politics to yourself! stay in your lane!) but that has _never_ been my philosophy. While I wouldn't advocate for "message art" per se (a term I remember hearing a lot in my upbringing as a Very Bad Thing), I think great art does and should have a message (even if very subtle). If art is communication‚Ä¶well then, **what are you communicating?**

Just marvel at this passage from _The Healing Room_:

> I have a universe inside me  
> Where I can go, an spirit guides me  
> There I can ask, oh, any question  
> I get the answers if I listen
> 
> I have a healing room inside me  
> The loving healers, there they feed me  
> They make me happy with their laughter  
> They kiss and tell me I'm their daughter  
> I'm their daughter

Poetry.

Or how about this selection from _Daddy I'm Fine_:

> Sorry to be disappointing  
> Wasn't born for no marrying  
> Wanna make my own living singing  
> Strong independent pagan woman singing
> 
> And I feel real cool and I feel real good  
> Got my hair shaved off and my black thigh boots  
> I stand up tall with my pride upright  
> I feel real hot when the makeup's nice  
> I get sexy underneath them lights  
> Like I wanna fuck every man in sight  
> Baby come home with me tonight  
> Make you feel good make you feel all right

Now that's Rock 'n' Roll!

Listen, I don't mean to sound like I'm droning on about "back in my day" because there's **always** great music being made everywhere and I truly adore plenty of new music (I regularly defy the common refrain that as you get older you only want to listen to the music of your youth). But I do feel like it can take some work to find songs which are so intensely **direct** and **personal** and feel like they've been **birthed right out of a real person's real lived experience**. You know when you read those lyrics and hear Sin√©ad O'Connor sing them that the _I_ of _I'm their daughter_, or the _I_ of _I told my poor worried father_, well that _I_ is unequivocally her.

**And it's glorious.**
