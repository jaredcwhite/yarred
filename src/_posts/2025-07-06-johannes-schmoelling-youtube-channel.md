title: Johannes Schmoelling (of Tangerine Dream)'s New YouTube Channel
---

Johannes Schmoelling is the **G.O.A.T.** As far as I'm concerned, when it comes to retro synthesizer music, he can do no wrong. He had a massive influence on Tangerine Dream when he joined the band in 1980, and even though he left after 1985, some of the greatest-ever electronic music was produced during his tenure.

Thus I am beyond thrilled that [Schmoelling has created a brand-new YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@JSchmoelling) featuring interviews and concert performances including several recent renditions of classic Tangerine Dream songs by his band, S.A.W. ([Hydragate](https://music.apple.com/us/album/hydragate/1689765000), SAW's second album, won my best of 2023 award). I'm just now digging into all this, and **I couldn't be more pleased.**
