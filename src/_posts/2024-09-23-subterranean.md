title: Subterranean Released
---

**Subterranean** essentially began 20 years ago. I wrote an initial take on the title track purely in Reason 2.0 on my then brand-new iMac G4. I never released it on an album. Fast forward to 2021, when I embarked on an entirely new treatment of the piece—and the rumblings of a truly special vibe. This sparked a flurry of effort for me to take a second look at a number of other pieces I'd worked on over the years.

This album simultaneously represents some of the most diverse explorations of various forms of electronica of my career, yet the sound remains entirely consistent. This is the hardest I've pushed into dance subgenres, with touches of trance, progressive house, drum'n'bass, breakbeat, and nu-disco throughout. At the same time, the influences of chillwave, ambient, and retro electronic music from the 80s and 90s cannot be denied. **Subterranean** is a collection of tracks which are rooted in genre yet entirely transcend it. At the end of the day, it is simply music made on synthesizers with love—and perhaps the occasional spark of divine fire.
