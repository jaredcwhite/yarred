## With Paul Ellis

Under my own name (Jared White), I'm pleased to announce my joint collaboration with Paul Ellis, one of the finest producers of ambient electronica and space music, for this unusually uptempo and energetic take on classic European-style electronic music.

From [Sylvain Lupari's review](https://www.synthsequences.com/post/ellis-white-unbroken-spirit-2022):

> Apart from his Berlin School style albums involving lines of sequences interwoven into minimalist rhythms, I can't remember hearing such a dynamic style of electronic music from Paul Ellis. Produced in duo with Jared White, better known as Yarred, _Unbroken Spirit_ is a wanted journey by Paul Ellis into the rockier areas of electronic music (EM). ...As surprising as unexpected from Paul Ellis and Yarred who affix an identity of their own, _Unbroken Spirit_ is a melodious album which plays however on very good memories of the 80's.

Personally, I'm very happy with out this project turned out. I think it's a great blend of our two styles and an invigorating addition to the retro electronica scene. Check it out!

## Past Collabs

From 2007-2010, Yarred was part of an electronic music duo known as **Binary Sea**. They released two albums, [_Compass_](http://blazingedgeproductions.com/compass.html) (2008) and [_Land Ho!_](http://blazingedgeproductions.com/land_ho.html) (2010), featuring a wide array of ambient and electronica styles.

From 1993-2005, Yarred recorded and toured extensively with the Celtic & Early Music band **Distant Oaks**. Their magnum opus, [_Gach LÃ  agus Oidhche: Music of Carmina Gadelica_](http://blazingedgeproductions.com/car_gad.html) (2003) is a tour de force of traditional yet surprisingly fresh Scottish Gaelic song and dance music. In the words of one Amazon reviewer, "if you are a fan of celtic music artfully done and with craft and heritage, this is a must-listen-to."
